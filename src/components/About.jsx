            I am a passionate Full-Stack Developer with over four years of
            experience in frontend and backend technologies, including React,
            Node.js, TypeScript, and MongoDB. With a strong focus on building
            scalable, user-centric applications, I thrive on solving complex
            challenges and delivering impactful solutions. Beyond coding, I
            practice CrossFit to push my limits and embrace challenges,
            constantly striving for personal growth. I also enjoy woodworking,
            where I channel my dedication to perfection and cultivate a
            craftsmanâ€™s mindset. This balance between technical expertise and
            hands-on creativity reflects my commitment to both innovation and
            precision in everything I do.
